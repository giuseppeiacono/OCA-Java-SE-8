# OCA-Java-SE-8

This project includes notes and exercises about [Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 8 Programmer](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certified-associate-java-se-8-programmer/trackp_333)

Kathy Sierra, <sub><sup>SCJP</sup></sub><br />
Bert Bates, <sub><sup>SCJP, OCA, OCP</sup></sub>

## Project Structure
ORACLE book has six chapters, accordingly this project consists of six modules that contain:
* one package for notes and/or examples related to the chapter content. I tried to resume those topics that are not totally clear to most programmers, in order to be ready for the exam!
* __self_tests__ package which consists of one folder per exercise. On the bottom of Java files you will find comments regarding to both correct and wrong answers, like below:<br />
    ```java
    /**
     * ______________________________________________________________________________
